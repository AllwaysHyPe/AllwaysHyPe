## About Me  

Fueled by coffee and a curiosity for solving real-world IT challenges, I specialize in **automation, endpoint management, and security**. My focus is on modernizing infrastructure with **scalable, user-centric solutions** that bridge security and usability.  

I believe that **good IT isn't just about technology, it's about people**. I thrive on solving real-world problems so others don’t have to, sharing what I’ve learned to help teams build systems that work—seamlessly, securely, and at scale.  

My experience spans **cloud-native architecture, automation pipelines, and endpoint security**, always with an emphasis on usability. Whether it’s streamlining deployments, securing endpoints, or improving workflows, I’m focused on **building solutions that make IT better for everyone**.
